Similarly to many other computer-based audio analysis systems, MATAA applies a test signal to the device under test and simultaneously records the response signal for subsequent analysis. MATAA uses the computers built-in soundcard (or an external audio module) to play and record test signals to and from a device under test.\r\n\r\nMATAA runs on all sorts of computer platforms because it uses Matlab or GNU Octave as a base (these are powerful number crunching programs which provide a huge toolbox of routines for data analysis and processing). For the same reason, MATAA is extremely flexible and easily extendible with custom test signals, data analyses, plotting procedures, and scrips to automate routine measurements.\r\n\r\nFurther instructions on how to install and use MATAA are available in the manual provided with MATAA.
