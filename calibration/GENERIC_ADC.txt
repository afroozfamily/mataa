% Generic example for calibratioon data file (ADC / analog digital conversion)% General information:name = GENERIC ADC			% name / descriptor of hardwaretype = ADC					% type of hardware ('DAC', 'ADC', 'MICROPHONE', or 'SENSOR')sensitivity = 0.73 1/V		% sensitivity of device, including unit (ratio of output/input signals)% The ADC is assumed to have sufficiently flat frequency response, so no transfer function data is included here.
