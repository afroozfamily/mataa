% Generic example for calibratioon data file (ADC / analog digital conversion)% General information:name = GENERIC ADCtype = ADCsensitivity = 0.7 1/V % 1V input at ADC input produces 70% digital level at ADC output% The ADC is assumed to have sufficiently flat frequency response, so no transfer function data is included here.
