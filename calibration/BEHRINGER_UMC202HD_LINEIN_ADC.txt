% Calibration file for BEHRINGER UMC202HD (ADC, LINE input)
%
% Line level output, without any extra amp or buffer
% Input gain control set to different levels (see sensitivity values below)
% PAD off (PAD = ON reduces input gain by 19 dB)
% Software mixer volume set to 100% (Mac OS X 10.10)
% Measured using an oscilloscope and DVM connected to the line-level input
% General information:name = BEHRINGER UMC202HD LINE-INtype = ADC%% sensitivity = 28.6 1/V	% input gain at maximum setting
sensitivity = 0.536 1/V % input gain at 50% setting
%% sensitivity = 0.0627 1/V % input gain at minimum setting% Frequency response was flat down to 5 Hz, so no transfer function data is included here. Analysis was difficult for lower frequencies
