% Generic example for calibratioon data file (DAC / digital-to-analog conversion)% General information:name = GENERIC DACtype = DACsensitivity = 2.5 V % 100% signal level at DAC input produces 2.5 V at DAC output% The DAC is assumed to have sufficiently flat frequency response, so no transfer function data is included here.
