* Add gain calibration. Idea: put values of microphone sensitivity, buffer gain, and (mic-)preamplifier gain into prefs. Then add a function mataa_fix_gain(signal,gains) that adjusts for these gains (where gains is a list of the gain types to be considered: buffer, preamp, mic sensitivity).

* Add calibration channel to loudspeaker analysis (or other acoustic tests).

* In the manual, explain how to test for the presence and the effectiveness of an anti-aliasing filter in the soundcard.

* Port TestTone and TestDevices to Linux. Or just stay with the current solution of providing the source code and instructions on how to compile it?
