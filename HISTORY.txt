MATAA History

* 9/10. March 2008: moved the settings file to the users home directory, and removed the mataa/mataa_data directory. Therefore, no user-specific data is intended to be written to the MATAA package directory, which greatly simplifies updating MATAA. The documentation has been updated accordingly. Please read the section about installation to find out how to set up the MATLAB/Octave startup file with the new and simplified directory structure.

* 2. February 2008: added a new function to fit impedance model to measured impedance data (mataa_impedance_fit_speaker).

* 20. January 2008: added a function to calculate loudspeaker impedance (magnitude and phase) using the MLSAA loudspeaker model (mataa_impedance_speaker_model). This is useful to interpret impedance curves in terms of Thielle/Small parameters, for instance.

* 9/10. January 2008: added import and export to/from FRD and TMD data files (mataa_import_FRD, mataa_export_FRD, mataa_import_TMD, mataa_export_TMD). The FRD file format is a standardized human readable format for storing time-domain data in an ASCII file (e.g. SPL frequency response data), see: http://www.pvconsultants.com/audio/frdis.htm. The TMD format is the analogous for time-domain data, but is a MATAA speciality rather than a standardized format.
Also, a function to import MLSSA data files has been added (mataa_import_MLSSA) . Thanks to Peter Svensson for contributing this! 

* 27. December 2007: rewrote much of the plotting routines to take advantage of the advanced plotting system of Octave 3.0 (i.e. improved compatibility with Matlab's handle graphics). The plotting routines of MATAA therefore rely on Octave 3.0 or later.

* 26. October 2007: added interchannel-delay compensation for impedance measurements. This allows reliable impedance measurements even with sound cards that produce signals that are not well aligned in the time domain. Look at the manual to learn more about interchannel delay.

* 24. October 2007: fixed a but in mataa_path that may have prevented MATAA to work on Windows computers with Octave.

* 12. August 2007: updated the documentation, added aX paper.

* Updated the documentation (note on sound I/O problems due to missing DLLs on Windows), added a new command to easily build menus on the Matlab/Octave command line [mataa_menu(...)].

* 9. April and 23. April 2007: minor modifications of the code to plot cumulative spectral decay diagrams.

* 6. March 2007:
Code clean up to fix minor problem with Octave on Windows, fix mataa_audio_info to properly return '(UNKNOWN)' as device name if the audio device is unknown.

* 26. February 2007:
Added support for simultaneous output of different test signals on multi-channel output devices (this is still experimental, so please report any issues). I also fixed a minor glitch which made Intel-Macs with Matlab look like an 'unknown' platform.

* 19. February 2007:
Fixed a few typos that would prevent proper code execution in Matlab (but not in Octave).

* 15. February 2007:
Added support for sound input and output on Windows. Shu Sang (sangshu@hotmail.com) compiled TestTone and TestDevices for Windows (thanks Shu!). Also fixed a minor bug reported by Morten Laursen in mataa_audio_info.m that caused an error in Matlab (but not in Octave).

* 4. February 2007:
Changed TestTone and TestDevices from Portaudio-18 to Portaudio-19 (to simplify compiling and building TestTone and TestDevices with Linux). Added info on sample-rate support depending on full or half duplex operation of audio device (e.g. if different devices are used for input and output). This changed the output format of TestTone and TestDevices. Therefore, the m-files interacting the TestTone and TestDevices were also changed accordingly.

* 30. January 2007:
- Expanded documentation (now includes a automatically generated list of all MATAA tools and their usage information).
- Improved mataa_selftest.m (don't try to determine audio latency if sound in/out does not work).

* 15. January 2007:
- Fixed string comparison: replaced "X == Y" by "strcmp(X,Y)"
- Fixed documentation to install MATAA with Octave (use "LOADPATH" instead of "path")

* 5. January 2007: First public release of MATAA
